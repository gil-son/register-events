# spring-boot-compilation


## Introduction
<p>This repository seeks to study Spring Boot, concepts, methodologies, libraries, mini-projects, etc ... It is important to understand the behind the scenes and not just code. Thus there will be a greater understanding which increase the possibilities of resolution, creation, prevention, etc.</p>



## What is Spring?</p>

<p>Spring is a backend tecnology and not only a framework, but a conjuct of projects thats resolve many problems. By have many projects inside Spring, call it ecosystem Spring.</p>

<p>The Spring help the developers in business rules, don't require spend time in organize architechure. Based on design patterns of inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injection.</p>

<p>Spring has an architecture based on interfaces and POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).</p>

### Some reasons:

<ul>
  <li>Mult-tasks</li>
  <li>Simples: preconfigured projects to production</li>
  <li>Maturity: works with responsible and secure architectures</li>
  <li>Modular: adapted to any systems and you can build with dependencies to specific project</li>
  <li>Adaptation: It is possible to combine with other technologies outside the Spring ecosystem</li>
  <li>Constante Evolution</li>
  <li>Open Source by Pivotal</li>
  <li>Big and Strong Community: foruns, documentations, events, etc...</li>
  <li>Popularity: many companies and developers are using</li>
</ul>


### Some applications:

<ul>
  <li>Web</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Validations</li>
  <li>API REST</li>
</ul>

 ### Spring Boot vs. Spring

<p>Spring is a framework with distinct tools can be combined and Spring Boot is a enviroment prepared to production and can integrations Spring tool in modules.</p>

<p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".</p>

<p>Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.</p>


### Features

<ul>
  <li>Create stand-alone Spring applications</li>
  <li>Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)</li>
  <li>Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration</li>
  <li>Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible</li>
  <li>Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration</li>
  <li>Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration</li>
</ul>
