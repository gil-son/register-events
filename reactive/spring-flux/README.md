# Reactive - Spring-Flux



## Introduction

<p>Reactive systems have certain characteristics that make them ideal for low-latency, high-throughput workloads. 
Project Reactor and the Spring portfolio work together to enable developers to build enterprise-grade reactive systems that are responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven.</p>

## What is reactive processing?
<p>Reactive processing is a paradigm that enables developers build non-blocking, asynchronous applications that can handle back-pressure (flow control).</p>

## Why use reactive processing?
<p>Reactive systems better utilize modern processors. Also, the inclusion of back-pressure in reactive programming ensures better resilience between decoupled components.</p>
